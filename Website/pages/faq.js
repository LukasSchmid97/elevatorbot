                        <p>
                            To invite the official bot to your discord server, click the subtle button at the top of
                            your screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, since the bot is fully open source, you can also host him yourself.
                            Check the ReadMe on GitHub for more information.

                            The <code>:text:</code> fragments are most likely emoji, or a newish discord feature.
                            Either way, it is not being displayed correctly.

                                The <code>@everyone</code> role does not have the <code>Use External

                            Be patient. After registering for the first time, I need to collect all your data which can
                            take quite a while.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This can also lead to wrong result when querying Destiny 2 stats.

                    <FAQItem title="Why are my roles not updating?">
                        <p>
                            The automatic update can take up to 24 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you used <code>/roles get</code> and have not received your new role, you may need to
                            wait for up to an hour.
                            Sadly I can't spam bungies api as much as I want, so you gotta wait until it is your turn.
